# discostar &mdash; program for calculating optical light curves of X-ray binaries with warped accretion disc and irradiation effect.

Program have been used in the work ["Modeling of 35-day superorbital cycle of B and V light curves of IMXB HZ Her/Her X-1"
](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200907181K/abstract)

documentation of the program are under development...
